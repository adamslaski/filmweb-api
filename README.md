# Filmweb API

Very simple unofficial and impartial API library to interact with the Filmweb.pl service.


In order to run tests add file `test/credentials.ts` containing
```javascript
export const credentials = { 
    "login": "your login", 
    "password": "your password"
    "sharpObjectsRecommValue": 17 // your recommendtion value (procent w Twoim gu≈õcie) for Sharp Objects
}
```
